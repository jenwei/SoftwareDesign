Salmonella Findings:

Using a threshold of 675 on the Salmonella DNA sequence, amino acids are produced. Using protein-BLAST, we search for the amino acid sequences produced. The type of genes in this seem to be anti-gens. 

(Note: I have a basic understanding of biology, so I cannot elaborate much more on this.)
